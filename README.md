Property Management System
Description In hotels a property management system, also known as a PMS, is a comprehensive software application used to cover objectives like coordinating the operational functions of front office, sales and planning, reporting etc. There are two accommodation types: hotel rooms and residency apartments. There are three types of hotel rooms: Standard, Deluxe, and Suites and two types of apartments: two bedrooms, and three bedrooms. Each room can accommodate 2 adults and 2 children.
Functional Requirements Develop a C# solution that should allow different user roles to create and edit bookings and generate occupancy and statistical reports. The solution should also be able to generate bill and replicate a payment process.
User Roles There should be user roles in the system, these can be considered as separate accounts with a different username and password. Roles should include front-desk staff, restaurant staff, and managers. The front-desk staff can create a booking, edit a booking start a check-in and check-out process, enter discount codes, and set additional fees. The restaurant staff can only add breakfast or room service meals. Managers can perform all the above and can delete existing services, delete a booking, and add a loyalty discount. Manager should be able to view and edit all bookings and produce reports, such as total bookings per week, total payments, occupancy rates, etc.
Bookings A booking is reserved by specifying the dates of stay and the duration of stay nights, Type of accommodation, number of rooms, and number of guests. Each booking should have a unique number and a paying guest name and information.
A booking can include breakfast for its guests. This is calculated as follows: 7£ per adult and 3 £
per child for each night.
Each booking will incur 5% VAT tax for the whole stay and 5£ tourism tax(per night).
Special offers can be included. For example, guests can get a discount based on loyalty
Between 10% to 20%, only with a manager approval. Some attractions can offer discount codes
such as “BIC” to get 15% or “UOB” to get 10%.
After check-in a booking can incur additional fees. For example, room services meals,
Spa services ,or airport transfer.
Solution Guidelines
All requirements should work as described with accurate calculations and formatting.
Use multi-forms and different types of controls. All forms and their controls should be coded and
fully functional.
Distribute the solution functionality and features amongst various forms, tabs menu items, and
controls, include various features rather than repeating the same features in each form.
Aim to have a clear and logical flow for the solution forms. The solution should be user friendly
and the solution should use colors, icons and images same as the company logos.
Use controls beyond the course scope like Calendar Controls, Toolbars, Dialogs, Reporting
Services, etc. Additionally, aim to release the solution with an installation package.
Deliverables
The project objective is to implement the required software solution in C#.
This should include.
A complete functional solution interface design and code for the software, with multi-forms and a
selection of active visual controls.
A database which is used by the solution data operations.
An accompanying report which includes a brief description of the project, its main features
And functionality, and walkthrough of the software including screenshots.
